## Core Philosophy

### Systems Over Heroes
Organizations are systems. Individual heroics can't compensate for broken systems. Focus on fixing structure, not just hiring better people.

### Career Ladders Are Agreements
Promotions aren't rewards for past behavior—they're agreements about future scope and expectations. A good ladder makes this explicit.

### Strategy Is a Theory
Engineering strategy should be a testable hypothesis about how to succeed, not a list of projects or a vision statement.

### Staff Engineers Do What's Needed
The best staff engineers do whatever the organization most needs, even if it's not what they'd choose. Flexibility is the skill.

## Signature Frameworks

1. **Staff Archetypes**: Tech Lead, Architect, Solver, Right Hand
2. **Trunk and Branches**: Infrastructure org model
3. **Engineering Strategy**: Diagnosis → Policies → Actions
4. **Systems Modeling**: Stocks, flows, and feedback loops for orgs

## Quotable

> "The best predictor of a productive relationship with a manager is whether they're personally invested in your career growth."

> "Staff engineers keep the company honest, keep the managers honest, and keep themselves honest."

> "Almost all organizational dysfunction comes from poor communication."

> "The hardest part of strategy is deciding what not to do."

## How to Apply His Thinking

When facing a leadership challenge:

1. **Model it as a system** - What are the stocks, flows, feedback loops?
2. **Look for structural causes** - Why does this behavior persist?
3. **Find leverage points** - Where can small effort create large change?
4. **Write it down** - Strategy, decisions, and rationale should be documented
5. **Update based on evidence** - Strategies are hypotheses to test

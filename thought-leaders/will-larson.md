## Core Philosophy

### Systems Over Heroes
Organizations are systems. Individual heroics can't compensate for broken systems. Focus on fixing structure, not just hiring better people.

### Career Ladders Are Agreements
Promotions aren't rewards for past behavior—they're agreements about future scope and expectations. A good ladder makes this explicit.

### Strategy Is a Theory
Engineering strategy should be a testable hypothesis about how to succeed, not a list of projects or a vision statement.

### Staff Engineers Do What's Needed
The best staff engineers do whatever the organization most needs, even if it's not what they'd choose. Flexibility is the skill.

## Signature Frameworks

1. **Staff Archetypes**: Tech Lead, Architect, Solver, Right Hand
2. **Trunk and Branches**: Infrastructure org model
3. **Engineering Strategy**: Diagnosis → Policies → Actions
4. **Systems Modeling**: Stocks, flows, and feedback loops for orgs

## Recent Perspectives (2025-2026)

### On AI and Engineering Leadership
Larson views facilitating AI adoption as "a side-quest for every engineering leader in the current era." He emphasizes that leaders should spend time working directly with new tools to develop intuition for how they work.

Since joining Imprint in 2025, he has returned to hands-on coding after a decade away, merging over 100 pull requests in six months—largely enabled by AI coding tools like Claude Code.

Key insight: "Every company should be doing internal AI agent work, very much including companies that aren't doing any sort of direct AI work in their product."

### On Engineering Strategy
His fourth book, *Crafting Engineering Strategy*, aims to change how the industry thinks about strategy. A core theme: "There's always an engineering strategy, even if there's nothing written down."

## Quotable

> "The best predictor of a productive relationship with a manager is whether they're personally invested in your career growth."

> "Staff engineers keep the company honest, keep the managers honest, and keep themselves honest."

> "Almost all organizational dysfunction comes from poor communication."

> "The hardest part of strategy is deciding what not to do."

> "There's always an engineering strategy, even if there's nothing written down."

> "The learning loop for writing software with agents is definitely not zero, but it's something you can learn for a few dollars of tokens and a couple dozen hours spent writing personal projects."

## How to Apply His Thinking

When facing a leadership challenge:

1. **Model it as a system** - What are the stocks, flows, feedback loops?
2. **Look for structural causes** - Why does this behavior persist?
3. **Find leverage points** - Where can small effort create large change?
4. **Write it down** - Strategy, decisions, and rationale should be documented
5. **Update based on evidence** - Strategies are hypotheses to test

# /reorg

Start an organizational design conversation.

## Trigger

User says `/reorg` or asks about team structure, org design, or reorganizations.

## Behavior

1. Understand the context:
   - What prompted the reorg consideration?
   - What's the current structure?
   - What problems are you trying to solve?

2. Apply Technical Coherence:
   - Map UX domains
   - Identify shared capabilities
   - Assess Product/Domain/Infrastructure layers

3. For infrastructure orgs, also apply Trunk and Branches:
   - What's in the trunk?
   - What are the branches?
   - Is sizing appropriate?

4. Help design target state and transition plan

## Key Questions

- Is the problem structure, or something else?
- Does current structure match product architecture?
- What's the minimum viable change?
- How will you measure success?

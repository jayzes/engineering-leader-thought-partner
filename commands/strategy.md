# /strategy

Start a strategy development conversation.

## Trigger

User says `/strategy` or asks about writing/reviewing engineering strategy.

## Behavior

1. Ask what kind of strategy help they need:
   - Writing a new strategy from scratch
   - Reviewing/improving an existing strategy
   - Communicating a strategy
   - Evaluating if a strategy is working

2. For new strategies, guide through:
   - Understanding the context
   - Developing the diagnosis
   - Crafting guiding policies
   - Defining coherent actions

3. For existing strategies, evaluate:
   - Is the diagnosis grounded in evidence?
   - Do policies flow from the diagnosis?
   - Are actions specific and coherent?
   - Are tradeoffs explicit?

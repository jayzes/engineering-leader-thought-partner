# First 90 Days as an Engineering Leader

*Source: Will Larson - lethain.com*

## Core Principle

Your first 90 days are for **learning, not changing**. You have permission to observe without immediately solving. Use it.

The biggest mistake new leaders make is moving too fast with too little context. Changes made in the first month often get unwound by month six.

## Phase 1: Listen (Days 1-30)

### Goals
- Build relationships
- Understand context
- Identify real problems (not presenting symptoms)
- Earn trust through curiosity, not authority

### Activities

**1:1s with everyone**
- Direct reports (weekly going forward)
- Skip-levels (at least once in first month)
- Peer leaders (understand their constraints)
- Key stakeholders (product, design, other functions)

**Questions to ask**:
- What's working well that I shouldn't break?
- What's the biggest problem I should know about?
- What did my predecessor do well? What would you change?
- What's something you wish leadership understood?
- If you were in my role, what would you do first?

**Observe**
- Attend existing meetings without changing them
- Read past documents (strategies, postmortems, ADRs)
- Watch how decisions get made
- Notice who has informal authority

### Outputs
- Relationship map: who influences what
- Running list of themes (not solutions yet)
- Understanding of existing commitments

## Phase 2: Diagnose (Days 30-60)

### Goals
- Synthesize what you've learned
- Form hypotheses about what needs to change
- Validate hypotheses with trusted advisors
- Begin to establish your perspective

### Activities

**Pattern matching**
- What themes came up repeatedly in 1:1s?
- Where do people agree? Disagree?
- What's everyone avoiding talking about?

**Deep dives**
- Pick 2-3 areas to understand deeply
- Read the code/architecture/systems
- Understand why things are the way they are

**Hypothesis testing**
- Share early thinking with your manager
- Test ideas with trusted reports
- Seek disconfirming evidence

### Outputs
- Draft diagnosis of key challenges
- Initial thoughts on approach
- Alignment with your manager on priorities

## Phase 3: Act (Days 60-90)

### Goals
- Make initial changes with clear rationale
- Build momentum without breaking things
- Establish your operating rhythm
- Set direction for the next period

### Activities

**Small wins**
- Fix obvious irritants that don't require big changes
- Remove blockers your team has been complaining about
- Make one meaningful process improvement

**Strategic moves**
- Share your diagnosis broadly
- Propose 2-3 priorities for the next quarter
- Begin longer-term changes (with patience)

**Establish rhythm**
- Finalize your meeting structure
- Set expectations for communication
- Define how decisions will be made

### Outputs
- Communicated priorities
- Initial wins that build credibility
- Framework for ongoing leadership

## Different Role Contexts

### First-time Manager
- Focus on basic management mechanics (1:1s, feedback, delegation)
- Resist urge to solve all technical problems yourself
- Build peer relationships with other new managers

### New Director
- Your job is now systems, not individuals
- Understand how teams interact
- Focus on manager effectiveness, not IC work

### New VP/CTO
- Executive presence from day one
- Build relationships across the company
- Quickly understand business context and constraints

### Coming from Outside vs. Promoted
- **Outside**: You have permission to ask "dumb questions" - use it
- **Promoted**: Fight the urge to keep doing your old job; prove you can grow

## What to Avoid

- **Big reorgs in month one**: You don't have context yet
- **Criticizing your predecessor**: You weren't there
- **Promising specific outcomes**: Under-promise until you understand
- **Changing everything at once**: Organizational capacity is limited
- **Avoiding hard conversations**: Building a reputation for avoidance is worse than early awkwardness

## Key Questions to Ask Yourself

1. What do I know now that I didn't know on day one?
2. What's my biggest remaining blind spot?
3. Who are my trusted advisors in this organization?
4. What's the one thing that would make the biggest difference?
5. Am I moving too fast? Too slow?

## Signs It's Going Well

- People are opening up in 1:1s
- You're being included in important conversations
- Your team seems cautiously optimistic
- Your manager is aligned with your direction
- You have a clear (if incomplete) picture of the landscape

## Signs to Worry About

- People are guarded or political
- You're not getting straight answers
- Surprises keep coming up
- Your manager and skip-level are misaligned
- You're already firefighting constantly

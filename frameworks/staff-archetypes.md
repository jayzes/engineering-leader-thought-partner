# Staff Engineer Archetypes

*Source: Will Larson - staffeng.com*

## Overview

Staff-plus engineers operate in fundamentally different ways depending on their organization's needs and their personal strengths. These four archetypes describe common patterns, though many staff engineers blend elements of multiple types.

## The Four Archetypes

### Tech Lead

**What they do**: Guide a single team's technical direction and execution. Deep partnership with the engineering manager. First among equals on technical decisions.

**Characteristics**:
- Embedded with one team long-term
- Balances hands-on coding with coordination
- Owns technical roadmap for their domain
- Mentors engineers on the team
- Often the "glue" between product and engineering

**When orgs need this**: Teams tackling complex domains that need sustained technical leadership. Good for teams where the EM isn't deeply technical.

**Path to this archetype**: Usually promoted from within a team after demonstrating both technical excellence and collaborative leadership.

### Architect

**What they do**: Design technical vision that spans multiple teams or the entire organization. Less code, more documents, diagrams, and influence.

**Characteristics**:
- Works across team boundaries
- Owns cross-cutting technical concerns
- Writes RFCs, ADRs, and strategy docs
- Reviews major technical decisions
- May not ship code regularly

**When orgs need this**: Companies with multiple teams that need alignment on technical direction. Especially valuable during major migrations or architecture transitions.

**Path to this archetype**: Often starts as a Tech Lead who naturally gravitates toward cross-team problems. Requires strong written communication.

### Solver

**What they do**: Parachute into the organization's hardest problems. Move from crisis to crisis, challenge to challenge.

**Characteristics**:
- High autonomy and mobility
- Tackles problems others have struggled with
- May not have a permanent team
- Deep technical skills in specific areas
- Often introvert-friendly—heads down on hard problems

**When orgs need this**: Companies with gnarly technical debt, complex migrations, or recurring performance crises. Also valuable during rapid growth when problems outpace team capacity.

**Path to this archetype**: Usually specialists who've solved similar problems before. Reputation built on "they fixed that impossible thing."

### Right Hand

**What they do**: Extend the reach of an executive (VP/CTO). Handle whatever the organization most needs, acting with executive authority.

**Characteristics**:
- Attends leadership meetings
- Executes strategic initiatives
- May manage temporary task forces
- Requires deep organizational trust
- Role shifts based on current priorities

**When orgs need this**: Executives who are stretched thin and need someone who can represent their perspective. Common in fast-growing companies or during major transitions.

**Path to this archetype**: Usually long tenure and deep trust with the executive. Often someone who "should be a director" but prefers individual contributor work.

## Matching Archetype to Context

| Situation | Best Archetype |
|-----------|---------------|
| Complex team needs technical leadership | Tech Lead |
| Multiple teams need alignment | Architect |
| Specific hard problem needs solving | Solver |
| Executive bandwidth is the bottleneck | Right Hand |

## Key Questions When Hiring/Promoting Staff

1. What problems does our organization actually have?
2. Which archetype addresses those problems?
3. Does this candidate naturally fit that archetype?
4. Do we have the organizational structure to support this archetype?

## Common Pitfalls

- Expecting all staff engineers to be Architects
- Hiring a Solver when you need a Tech Lead (they'll get bored)
- Creating Right Hand roles without executive commitment
- Promoting to staff without clarity on which archetype you need

## The "Title Matters" Tension

Staff engineers often say "title doesn't matter, impact does." And also "I couldn't have had this impact without the title."

Both are true. The title provides:
- Access to rooms where decisions happen
- Default credibility with stakeholders
- Organizational permission to work across boundaries

But the title alone accomplishes nothing—it just removes friction.
